        You're probably wondering what's up with this squishy dude. <br><br>
        His name is Blobby, he won't hurt you. His job is to actually keep you company and to spread love! <br><br>
        He wouldn't harm anyone or anything! Not even a little old worm...</th>

          His name is Wrigglez and people around the streets call him a cool guy.<br><br>

          He calls himself the big boss around here but don't tell him I said this...
          But King Slowpe is ruler of all.

      He becomes more powerful the more people he pushes or makes fun of.<br><br>
      King Slowpe has not found him yet. People report the incidents too late. <br><br>
      Making him unable to be caught.
