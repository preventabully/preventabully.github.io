        <p>One time I saw some homeless man being bullied by other men.
          They pushed him around and dragged him on the floor, and finally left him after a few minutes.
          The homeless man was shaking and walked away.</p><br>

        <p>I used to be bully for my height. I'm shorter then my average height so I get teased alot for that.
          Most of the time I'm fine with it and I'll just ignor them but sometimes they cross the line. I didn't know what
          to do and I use to be a very weak person so I cried and that's when they called me a cry baby. And so I went home in
           a very bad mood. I did not tell anyone so I don't worrie them. Then soon enough the bullying just got worst. I decided
           that I need to Change. So I did. I began to slowly turn into a tomboy. And I thought if I was short and can't grow any
           taller I decided to jump. So I did and soon enough I jumped much higher then someone usually will for my height. Then the
           bullying stop. Why? Simply because I prove to them being short is not something to be ashamed of. I was stronger and I had
           more confidence in myself. And from that day one No one bullyed me anymore!</p><br>

        <p>Once my friend told me about her friend being made fun of by this other popular mean girl.
          This girl liked makeup but didn't have a lot of money to spend on it so she went for more low-end brands.
          The popular girl walked in the bathroom, saw the girl applying makeup, and offered to give her some of her more
          high-end products. Of course, the girl was happy, but my friend later overheard the popular girl making fun of the girl's
          products and said that she gave away her makeup because she pitied her. Even though the girl never found out, it was still disrespectful and the popular girl was still a bully.</p><br>

        <p>There is a girl in my class that always makes “touches” of people.  And I was one of them.
          When I am around her or next to her, she would make this weird face and smear her hand onto someone else.
          Then that person would do the same thing.  She also makes touches out of other people, especially the boys.
          I try to ignore this.  Many of my friends stand up for me which is great, but I don’t think it really helps.
          The girl that has been doing the touches was in my class since kindergarten and started this trend in fourth grade.  </p><br>

        <p>I was a chubby kid back in middle school. I really didn't think much of it when my friends
          pointed out my belly because it made them laugh whenever they squeezed it. One day, I was playing rock,
          paper, scissors with a group. The teams were broken down and the loser had to try doing a full split,
           and of course I got unlucky and lost. So I naturally did a split without breaking a sweat because I took
           Tae Kwon Doe classes before. But for some reason everyone looked surprised that I could do one. One of them asked
           "How could you do a split if you're so fat?". Everyone laughed at me. More comments were made directed at my weight.
           I thought I was being pushed into a corner because no one stood up for me. I was too scared to talk back to them and kept my
           mouth shut. I spent the rest of my day thinking about it and made me feel really insecure for the longest time. I remember
           I didn't eat lunch or dinner trying to go on a "diet" for a couple of weeks or maybe months. Even today I still remember that
           situation so specifically and I wished that someone was there to back me up.</p><br>
