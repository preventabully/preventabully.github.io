            A Gold Award is the highest achievement a girl scout can receive.
            It is given to senior or ambassadors who have done
            something to benefit the greater good.<br><br>
            <b>My mission was to spread awareness of bullying and cyber-bullying.</b><br><br>
            By posting definitions, experiences, and ways to prevent it,
            I believe that this website can educate students and adults about this problem.
            In the homescreen, you can see that the word EXPERIENCES is in the center, capitalized.
            Clicking that button will lead to the experience tab where paragraphs of real life
            bullying occur.<br><br>
            I feel like when people read the experience section, they will treat bullying as a more
            serious issue. Reading all the things that people have gone through would hopefully
            help reach my goal of spreading awareness of bullying and cyberbullying.<br><br>
            I have experienced bullying in the past. Classmates would make fun of my weight and how
            circular my body was shaped. This project is very important to me because this website focuses
            on kids. This website includes drawings and gifs to entertain the users so it wouldn't bore the
            younger audience. I put in a short cute story on bystanders and what not to do when in a
            dangerous situation. <br><br>When I was being made fun of because of my weight, I was too scared to tell
            the teacher because I even thought that I would be called a "tattletell" from my classmates.
            But this website is here to reassure kids that telling the right people what to do will
            keep them safe and out of harm.
