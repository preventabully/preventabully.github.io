      <h1 class="uhead">What is bullying?</h1>
      <p class="whatbully"><br>The definition of bullying is the act of aggressive behavior towards another person. <br>
        This could happen anywhere; In school, <br>
        in a workplace or anywhere else in the world. <br>
        There are different types of bullying such as physical or verbal bullying. <br>
        Physical bullying acts hurt the person’s body or their property. <br>
        These include punching, stealing, and shoving, which are all violent actions.<br>
        Verbal bullying however has the same affect but some differences. <br>
        It uses speech as a way to downgrade others rather than physical actions. <br>
        Verbal bullying acts include threats, spreading rumors, and calling names.<br>
        This may seem as a joke to some but to others it's a poke at their insecurities.<br><br>

          once it’s on the web, people can share and save it onto their device,<br>
          making it hard to delete something completely.<br>
          This is how easy rumors are spread. <br>

          and now their friends can see the post.<br>
          It can go on and on and many people can see what it says. <br>
          Cyberbullying can happen anytime of the day.<br><br> </p>
