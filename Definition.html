      <p class="whatbully EAE0D5 "><br>The definition of bullying is the act of aggressive behavior towards another person.
        This could happen anywhere; In school,
        in a workplace or anywhere else in the world.
        There are different types of bullying such as physical or verbal bullying.
        Physical bullying acts hurt the person’s body or their property.
        These include punching, stealing, and shoving, which are all violent actions.
        Verbal bullying however has the same affect but some differences.
        It uses speech as a way to downgrade others rather than physical actions.
        Verbal bullying acts include threats, spreading rumors, and calling names.
        This may seem as a joke to some but to others it's a poke at their insecurities.<br>

          <p class="whatcyber EAE0D5" ><br>The definition of cyberbullying has the same concept as verbal bullying.
          It is the act of bullying through the use of an
          electronic device such as a computer or a phone.
          Since social media is such a popular trend now, many people across the globe
          browse the web with applications such as Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.
          Posting something on the internet can be difficult to remove because
          once it’s on the web, people can share and save it onto their device,
          making it hard to delete something completely.
          This is how easy rumors are spread.
          The post can be seen from that person’s friends then they can share it
          and now their friends can see the post.
          It can go on and on and many people can see what it says.
                    Cyberbullying can happen anytime of the day.<br><br> </p>
